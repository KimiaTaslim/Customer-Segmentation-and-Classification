## 📄 Project Overview
This project focuses on exploring and analyzing the **Mall Customers** dataset using various **data mining and machine learning techniques**.  
The goal is to extract meaningful patterns about customer behavior through visualization, clustering, and classification methods.

## 🔍 Project Steps
1. **Data Exploration and Visualization**
   - Identified attribute types (nominal, numeric).
   - Created box plots, histograms, and category plots to analyze customer demographics and spending behavior.

2. **Clustering Analysis**
   - Implemented **Hierarchical Clustering** and **Density-Based Clustering (DBSCAN)**.
   - Compared clustering performance using the **Silhouette Score** metric.
   - Found that the hierarchical method achieved better separation and overall clustering quality.

3. **Classification**
   - Applied **Decision Tree** and **Naïve Bayes (GaussianNB)** classifiers to predict customer gender based on other attributes.
   - Evaluated models using accuracy, recall, and precision metrics.
   - Concluded that both models had limited accuracy for this dataset, indicating potential for improvement with more suitable data.

---

## 📊 Results Summary
- **Best Clustering Method:** Hierarchical (higher Silhouette Score)  
- **Classification Accuracy:** ~47% overall  
- **Observation:** The dataset is not ideal for gender classification due to overlapping feature distributions.
